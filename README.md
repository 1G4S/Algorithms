# Algorithms 
Algorithm is sequence of some activities necessary to perform specified tasks. It's a course of action that should lead us to solution of problem.
### Here are some implemented algorithms by myself in Java:
* **[Number Algorithms](src/main/java/com/app/algorithms/number_algorithms)**
  * Fibonacci sequence
  * Sieve of Eratosthenes
  * Prime Number Check
  * Perfect Number Check
  * Calculate sum of digits in a number
* **[String Algorithms](src/main/java/com/app/algorithms/string_algorithms)**
  * Checking if the word is palindrome
  * Checking if the word is anagram
  * Hamming Distance between two strings
* **[Cryptography](src/main/java/com/app/cipher)**
  * Caesar cipher
