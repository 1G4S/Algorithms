     * In other words, it has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. This method checks for primality
     * using efficient checks and optimizations. First, it handles edge cases (numbers less than 2, and 2 and 3 themselves).
     * Then, it eliminates numbers divisible by 2 and 3. For larger numbers, it iterates over potential factors from 5
     * up to the square root of the number, in steps of 6 (i.e., checks i and i+2 within each loop), to quickly identify
     * divisibility by any smaller prime number.
     * <p>
     * The algorithm initially checks if the number is less than 2 (not prime), or is 2 or 3 (prime). Then, it checks
     * for divisibility by 2 or 3 to quickly eliminate multiples of these. For numbers greater than 3 that are not divisible
     * by 2 or 3, it proceeds to check potential factors starting from 5, incrementing by 6 each time (since all primes
     * greater than 3 are of the form 6k Â± 1). If the number is divisible by any of these or the immediate next number
     * (i.e., i+2), it is not prime. If no divisors are found by the time the loop reaches the square root of the number,
     * the number is prime.
