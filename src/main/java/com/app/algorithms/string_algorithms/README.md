## [Checking if the Word is a Palindrome ](https://github.com/1G4S/Algorithms/blob/3a090b95378aeeef547994ae763c26f8ea7a47db/src/main/java/com/app/algorithms/stringAlgorithms/StringAlgorithms.java#L17)

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). The check involves comparing characters from the beginning and the end of the string, moving towards the center.

## [Checking if the Word is an Anagram ](https://github.com/1G4S/Algorithms/blob/9f2791656e76176dce66da56f4991221304fa4c8/src/main/java/com/app/algorithms/stringAlgorithms/StringAlgorithms.java#L6)

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. The algorithm checks if two strings are anagrams by comparing sorted characters of both strings or by counting the occurrences of each character in both strings and then comparing these counts.
