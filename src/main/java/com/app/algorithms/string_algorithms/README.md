# String Algorithms Descriptions

## [Checking if the Word is a Palindrome ](https://github.com/1G4S/Algorithms/blob/4c28f07856f4e21f2e049042abcd15f636e842ff/src/main/java/com/app/algorithms/string_algorithms/StringAlgorithms.java#L34)

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (
ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). The check involves comparing characters from the beginning and the
end of the string, moving towards the center.

## [Checking if the Word is an Anagram ](https://github.com/1G4S/Algorithms/blob/4c28f07856f4e21f2e049042abcd15f636e842ff/src/main/java/com/app/algorithms/string_algorithms/StringAlgorithms.java#L15)

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the
original letters exactly once. The algorithm checks if two strings are anagrams by comparing sorted characters of both
strings or by counting the occurrences of each character in both strings and then comparing these counts.

## [Hamming Distance between two strings](https://github.com/1G4S/Algorithms/blob/4c28f07856f4e21f2e049042abcd15f636e842ff/src/main/java/com/app/algorithms/string_algorithms/StringAlgorithms.java#L51)

Hamming Distance is an algorithm that count number of positions at which the corresponding character is different
between two strings of equal length.

## [Levenshtein Distance](https://github.com/1G4S/Algorithms/blob/4c28f07856f4e21f2e049042abcd15f636e842ff/src/main/java/com/app/algorithms/string_algorithms/StringAlgorithms.java#L81)

The Levenshtein distance is a measure of the difference between two sequences.
It is quantified as the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions)
required to change one word into the other.
